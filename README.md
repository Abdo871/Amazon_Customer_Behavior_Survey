# Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Customer Behavior

### Description:
I recently conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon customer behavior using a dataset from Kaggle. The code and analysis were performed in a Jupyter Notebook, and I would like to share some key findings and insights from the analysis.

Summary:
The EDA involved analyzing a dataset containing information about Amazon customers, including their demographics, purchasing behavior, browsing patterns, product reviews, and satisfaction levels. The dataset consisted of 602 entries and 23 columns.

Key Steps:
1. Data Loading and Overview: I used Pandas to load the dataset and gain an initial understanding of its structure. The dataset contained information such as age, gender, purchase frequency, personalized recommendation frequency, browsing frequency, and more.

2. Data Cleaning: I performed data cleaning by dropping any rows with missing values to ensure the dataset was complete.

3. Data Exploration: I conducted various exploratory analyses to gain insights into customer behavior. This included examining the distribution of demographic variables, such as age and gender. I also explored the frequency of different purchase categories and the importance customers placed on personalized recommendations.

4. Data Visualization: To enhance the understanding of the data, I utilized Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects libraries to create interactive visualizations. These visualizations helped visualize patterns and trends in customer behavior.

5. Key Findings: Some of the key findings from the analysis include the gender distribution among Amazon customers, the frequency of purchases in different categories, and the importance customers placed on personalized recommendations.

6. Conclusion: The analysis provided valuable insights into Amazon customer behavior, which can be utilized by marketing teams to better understand customer preferences and tailor their strategies accordingly.
